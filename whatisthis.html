<p>This is an implementation of a sequent calculus, a formal system of a mathematical proof. The intent of this program is to help students of mathematical logic learn how a sequent calculus works.</p>
<p>This sequent calculus is roughly based on <a href="http://www.math.uni-bonn.de/ag/logik/teaching/2014SS/mathematische%20logik/Scriptum01.pdf">this lecture notes by Peter Koepke</a>.</p>
<p>Each derivation consists of a formula to the right of the turnstile which has been successfully proven from the assumptions on the left side of the turnstile \(\vdash\).
  A new derivation comes from applying one of the rules to earlier derivations.</p>
<p>You have to start with either the assumption rule \(\begin{matrix} & & \\\hline \Gamma & \varphi & \varphi \end{matrix}\) (click on it and then on "Use with \(\Gamma=\{\}\)") or the \(=\)-introduction rule \(\begin{matrix} & \\\hline \Gamma & t = t \end{matrix}\).</p>

<p>Sometimes it is necessary to build or complete a formula. This can be done through the formula builder. Build a formula from its outermost operation down to the innermost atomic formula and then build a term if necessary.</p>

This is still work in progress!

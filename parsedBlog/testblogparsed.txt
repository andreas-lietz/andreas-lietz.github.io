      <p>There are two different ways to approach learning (or teaching for that matter) forcing. Both come with their own strengths and weaknesses. </p>
<p>First, there is the "hands-on" approach:The slogan here is to "jump directly into action". Work with a general partial order, define dense sets, generic filters, names and 
construct the forcing extension as the evaluation of all names in the ground model by the generic filter. This is certainly the shortest path towards the forcing theorem
and applications of forcing, say the consistency of $\neg\mathrm{CH}$ with $\mathrm{ZFC}$.</p>
<p>The other possibility is to take the road through the Boolean forest. Define complete Boolean algebras, Boolean valued models, construct the Boolean valued model associated to a 
forcing and mod out by a generic filter. This introduces some significant overhead and additional abstraction. However one benefits from a significantly smoother theory. Just as a basic example, in the definition of the internal forcing relation, the 
statement 
$$\{q\leq p\mid \exists \dot x\in V^{\mathbb P}\ q\Vdash \varphi(\dot x)\}\text{ is dense below }p$$
is less readable to me than 
$$p\leq \sup_{\dot x\in V^{\mathbb B}}\Vert \varphi(\dot x)\Vert.$$
But much more importantly, one can proof theorems about the theory of forcings which are simply not true for mere partial orders.</p>
<p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start;"><b style="padding: 0 4px;flex: 0;">Theorem</b><span style="flex: 1;"> 
    Suppose $\mathbb B$, $\mathbb C$ are cBa's, $G\subseteq\mathbb B$ and $H\subseteq \mathbb C$ are generic over $V$ and $V[G]=V[H]$.
    Then there are $b\in\mathbb B$ and $c\in\mathbb C$ with $\mathbb B\upharpoonright b\cong \mathbb C\upharpoonright c$.
</span></div>
</p>
<p>Though the biggest problem using this apporach is that <b> nobody knows what a complete Boolean algebra is</b>! Obviously, this is not exactly true, but chances are that if you ask 
a random mathematician what a Boolean algebra is, they will at least have to ponder for a short bit before coming up with the three operations and the 8 laws that they have to obey.</p>
<p>Even worse, some of these laws do not have an immediate motivation coming from forcing. Even worse<i>er</i>, Boolean algebras are technically trivial forcings as they have a minimal
element $0_{\mathbb B}$, so one has to carry around a little $\times$ in the pocket and write $\mathbb B^\times$ instead. </p>
<p>Indeed, one must infer the order on a Boolean algebra from the other operations first before forcing. This is totally backwards! We only really care about the order!
On the other hand, the order carries the full information about the Boolean algebra: We can define 
$$b\wedge c = \inf \{b, c\},\ b\vee c = \sup \{b, c\} \text{ and } \neg b =\sup\{c\in\mathbb B\mid c\perp b\}.$$
This suggests strongly that it is possible to characterize the partial orders which are induced by complete Boolean algebras. I would be surprised if this has not been done before,
but I could not find anything in the literature, please let me know of a source if you know about one!</p>
<p>In any case, let us start with separativity. A partial order is seperative if whenever $p\not\leq q$ then there is some $r\leq p$ with $r\perp q$. This property is easily motivated
from a forcing perspective, as any partial order is forcing equivalent to the corresponding separative quotient. Passing to this quotient gets rid of "unnecessary fluff" that does not
carry any relevant information.</p>
<p>It is well-known that any Boolean algebra is seperative, so this should be part of our characterization. Clearly that does not suffice though!</p>
<p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start;"><b style="padding: 0 4px;flex: 0;">Definition</b><span style="flex: 1;">
Suppose $\mathbb P$ is a partial order and $X\subseteq \mathbb P$ so that $\sup X$ exists. Then the supremum $\sup X$ is optimal if $X$ is predense below $\sup X$. We say that $\mathbb P$ admits
optimal suprema if any non-empty $X\subseteq\mathbb P$ has a supremum and these suprema are all optimal.
</span></div>
</p>
<p>If a supremum is optimal then basically "no information of $X$ is lost when passing to $\sup X$". Here is an instructive example of a non-optimal supremum: Consider the forcing 
$$\mathbb P=\{p\colon n\rightarrow \omega\mid n<\omega}$$
ordered by extension. This is of course one representation of Cohen forcing. For $i=7, 42$, let $p_i$ be the condition with domain $\{0\}$ which sends $0$ to $i$ and $X=\{p_7, p_42\}$.
From a forcing perspective, $X$ says "the generic Cohen real will map $0$ to either $7$ or $42$". Notice that $X$ has a supremum in $\mathbb P$, namely $\sup X=\emptyset$. But now all 
information of $X$ has been lost in translation, this is terrible!</p>
<p>From a forcing perspective, suprema are only interesting if they are optimal. The supremum of some $X\subseteq\mathbb P$ should be $\mathbb{1}$ only if $X$ is predense (or in other words,
if the downwards closure of $X$ is dense). It is easily seen that complete Boolean algebras admit optimal suprema, so let us add this property to our list.</p>
<p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start;"><b style="padding: 0 4px;flex: 0;">Definition</b><span style="flex: 1;">
A <b>complete Boolean order</b> is a partial order which is seperative and admits optimal suprema.
</span></div>
</p>
<p>It turns out that this is already it! </p>
<p><div style="display: flex; justify-content: flex-start;"><b style="padding: 0 4px;flex: 0;">Lemma</b><span style="flex: 1;">
The following are equivalent for any partial order $\mathbb P$:
<p>$(1)$ There is a complete Boolean algebra $\mathbb B$ with $\mathbb P=\mathbb B^\times$</p>
<p>$(2)$ $\mathbb P$ is a complete Boolean order.</p>
</span></div>
</p>
<p>Only these two properties are necessary to complete characterize cBa's and both of them are natural.</p>
<p>
WIP, to be continued!</p>

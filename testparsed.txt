There are two different ways to approach learning (or teaching for that matter) forcing. Both come with their own strengths and weaknesses. <p>First, there is the "hands-on" approach:The slogan here is to "jump directly into action". Work with a general partial order, define dense sets, generic filters, names and 
construct the forcing extension as the evaluation of all names in the ground model by the generic filter. This is certainly the shortest path towards the forcing theorem
and applications of forcing, say the consistency of $\neg\mathrm{CH}$ with $\ZFC$.<\p>
<p>The other possibility is to take the road through the Boolean forest. Define complete Boolean algebras, Boolean valued models, construct the Boolean valued model associated to a 
forcing and mod out by a generic filter. <\p>

    Suppose $\BB$, $\CC$ are cBa's, $G\subseteq\BB$ and $H\subseteq \CC$ are generic over $V$ and $V[G]=V[H]$.
    Then there are $b\in\mathbb B$ and $c\in\mathbb C$ with $\BB\rest b\cong \CC\res c$.

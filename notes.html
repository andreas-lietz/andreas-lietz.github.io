            <p>This page contains mostly notes on small bits of mathematics that I found interesting. Any comments are welcome!</p>

                        The ${<}\kappa$-mantle is the intersection of all grounds that extend to $V$ via a forcing of size
                        ${<}\kappa$. For various cardinals $\kappa$, we show that the axiom of choice can fail in the
                        $\kappa$-mantle. This answers a question of Usuba. An interesting question left open is whether
                        choice can fail in the ${<}\kappa$-mantle if $\kappa$ is weakly compact.

                    <aside class = "infoaside">The well-known Zipper lemma from inner model theory implies that if an iteration
                        tree on $V$ has two different well-founded cofinal branches $b$ and $c$ with corresponding models
                        $M_b$ and $M_c$ and $\delta=\delta(T)$ then $L(V_\delta^{M_b})$ believes $\delta$ to be Woodin. Note
                        that choice may fail in this model. Martin and Steel mention in "Iteration Trees" that it is a theorem
                        Woodin and Solovay that one can force choice over this model while retaining $\delta$ to be Woodin.
                        As far as I know, this is not published. We present a proof of this result that makes use of
                        "Laver functions for a Woodin cardinal".

                    <aside class = "infoaside">Exercise 34.5 in Jech's "Set Theory" characterises when a given Boolen algebra is
                        isomorphic to the Levy collapse of an inaccessible cardinal to $\omega_1$. It turns out that as stated,
                        this characterisaion is false. We fix this, fix the use of this exercise in Theorem 34.5 and show
                        that $\operatorname{Col}(\omega, \kappa)\times\operatorname{Col}(\kappa, {<}\lambda)$ is not isomorphic
                        to $\operatorname{Col}(\omega, {<}\lambda)$ for inaccessible $\kappa<\lambda$. This makes it more
                        complicated to get a dense ideal on $\omega_1$ from an almost huge cardinal.

                        This result is published in Foremans's Handbook article. In this note, we present this result in full detail and try
                        to motivate the strategy. A byproduct of this was the note titled "The Problem with Exercise 34.5".</aside>

                    <aside class = "infoaside">The main aim of theis note is to give an easy construction of a transitive model of Zermelo set theory
                    that does not satisfy the axiom of transitive containment, i.e. all sets are subsets of a transitive set. As far as I know, there
                    is no such construction in the literature. We go on and build a few more pathological models of Zermelo set theory and show
                    that they need not have a "hierarchy", i.e. no definable sequence of sets that vaguely resemble the Von Neumann hierarchy.</aside>

                        the property of ccc + preserving a given Suslin tree is preserved by finite support iterations. This
                        is certainly well-known, but was not by the author.
